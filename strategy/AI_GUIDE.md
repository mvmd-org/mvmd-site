# AI Assistant Guide for MVMD Documentation Restructuring

This document serves as the primary reference for AI assistants working on the MVMD documentation restructuring project. It explains the purpose of all other documents and provides guidance on how to approach the restructuring work.

## Project Overview

We are restructuring the MVMD (Metaverse Metadata Directory) documentation to improve organization, clarity, and user experience. The documentation is being reorganized according to the Diátaxis framework, which separates content into distinct types based on their purpose:

1. **Fundamentals** (learning-oriented content)
2. **How-To Guides** (task-oriented content)
3. **Reference** (information-oriented content)
4. **Examples** (code samples with explanations)

Additionally, we maintain specialized sections for **Integration Profiles**, **Community**, and **Tools**.

## Key Documents

### 1. RESTRUCTURING_PLAN.md

This document outlines the overall restructuring plan, including:
- Project goals and strategy
- Step-by-step process for restructuring
- Current status of each step
- Final documentation structure
- Guidelines for the review process

When working on the project, always refer to this document first to understand which step we're currently on and what needs to be done next.

### 2. DOCUMENT_STANDARDS.md

This document defines the standards and templates for each content type:
- Purpose and format requirements for each type
- Standard structure templates with section examples
- Cross-linking standards
- Document metadata requirements
- File naming conventions
- Quality checklist

Use this document when creating or editing content to ensure it follows the established standards for its type.

### 3. CURSOR_WORKFLOW.md

This document provides Cursor-specific instructions for implementing the restructuring:
- Specific commands for working with files
- How to use git operations within Cursor
- Best practices for file editing in Cursor
- Handling Markdown formatting in Cursor
- Tips for efficient navigation between files

Refer to this document for technical guidance on working within the Cursor environment.

### 4. iteration/audit_log_v1.md

This document contains the results of the content audit:
- Findings from reviewing existing documentation
- Identified issues and misplaced content
- Recommendations for content reorganization
- Summary of patterns found across documentation

Use this document as a reference when moving and refactoring content to understand what needs to be fixed in each file.

## Workflow for AI Assistants

1. **Always check the current step** in RESTRUCTURING_PLAN.md before proceeding
2. **Follow established standards** from DOCUMENT_STANDARDS.md when working with content
3. **Use the appropriate techniques** from CURSOR_WORKFLOW.md when editing files
4. **Refer to audit findings** in iteration/audit_log_v1.md when addressing content issues
5. **Propose changes incrementally** for user review and approval
6. **Document your reasoning** when suggesting significant changes
7. **Cross-reference between documents** to ensure consistency

## Best Practices

1. **Minimize content duplication** - If content belongs in multiple places, choose the most appropriate location and link from other locations
2. **Respect existing content** - Make only necessary changes to preserve valuable information
3. **Follow the established structure** - Place content in the correct section according to the Diátaxis framework
4. **Maintain consistent navigation** - Ensure sidebar structure reflects the organizational hierarchy
5. **Focus on user experience** - Consider the documentation from the perspective of different user types

## Communication with Users

When communicating with users about the restructuring:
1. Be clear about which step of the plan you're addressing
2. Reference specific documents and sections when discussing changes
3. Provide clear reasoning for proposed changes
4. Present options when multiple approaches are viable
5. Confirm understanding before proceeding with significant changes
