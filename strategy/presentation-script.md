# MVMD Presentation Script

## Introduction & Setting the Stage (1:30)
- Welcome everyone. As members of the Metaverse Standards Forum working group for standards registration, you're crucial to helping standards organizations understand and adopt MVMD
- MVMD is a collaborative initiative focused on enhancing interoperability in the metaverse ecosystem
- Our goal is to bridge the gap between various metadata standards and create a unified approach for asset creators and platforms
- Today, I'll show you how MVMD addresses critical gaps affecting asset creators and platform interoperability, and how you can help standards organizations understand its value

## Homepage Walkthrough: The Big Picture & Core Problem (3:00)
*(Live screen share of mvmd.org)*

- MVMD is the bridge, not a new standard
- Connects Schema.org, glTF, USD, VRM, C2PA, and other standards
- Core challenge: Creators need guidance on combining multiple standards
- Platforms struggle to ingest and understand assets consistently
- MVMD provides the necessary integration framework

Key sections to highlight:
- Integration Profiles: Practical 'roadmaps' for creators
- For Standards Organizations: Making standards usable by creators and consumable by platforms
- Docs: Detailed framework enabling clarity

## The Metaverse Standards Challenge (3:00)
- Today's metaverse ecosystem relies on numerous excellent standards:
  - glTF for 3D model representation
  - USD for complex scene composition
  - VRM for humanoid avatars
  - FBX for animation and rigging
  - COLLADA for asset exchange
  - X3D for web-based 3D graphics
  - OpenXR for VR/AR experiences
  - CityJSON for urban environment modeling
  - 3D Tiles for large-scale geospatial data
  - C2PA for content authentication

- Real-world impact of fragmentation:
  - Creators struggle to combine standards effectively
  - Platforms face inconsistent asset implementations
  - Users experience limited interoperability between metaverse spaces

## The MVMD Solution (4:00)
*(Navigate to Introduction: mvmd.org/docs/introduction)*

Our approach consists of five key components:

1. **Metaverse Asset Standards**
   - Leveraging established standards
   - Each standard provides specialized capabilities
   - Maintaining compatibility with existing implementations

2. **Schema.org & JSON-LD Foundation**
   - Using Schema.org vocabulary with JSON-LD
   - Creates standardized metadata foundation
   - Enables semantic understanding across platforms

3. **MVMD Integration Profiles**
   *(Navigate to Integration Profiles Overview)*
   - Specific profiles defining precise integration patterns
   - Examples include:
     - Composable 3D NFT Profile
     - Digital Asset Profile
   - Each profile tailored for specific use cases
   - Provides clear guidance for creators

4. **Digital Assets Implementation**
   - Enabling NFTs and digital assets with consistent metadata
   - Supporting blockchain integration
   - Facilitating cross-platform asset portability

5. **Interoperable Ecosystem**
   - Creating seamless experiences across:
     - Metaverse platforms
     - Digital asset stores
     - Web3 explorers

## How You Can Help Standards Organizations Understand MVMD (4:00)
*(Navigate to For Standards Organizations)*

As members of the standards registration working group, you can help standards organizations understand:

1. **Integration Profile Development**
   - How MVMD helps their standard work with others
   - The value of having their standard represented in integration profiles
   - The importance of cross-standard compatibility

2. **Technical Working Groups**
   - The benefits of participating in MVMD's technical discussions
   - How their input shapes implementation guidelines
   - The opportunity to influence metaverse interoperability

3. **Documentation and Resources**
   - How to effectively document their standard's integration
   - The value of providing implementation examples
   - The importance of clear integration guides

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - The role of interoperability testing
   - How to validate their standard's integration
   - Ensuring robust cross-standard compatibility

## Key Messages to Share with Standards Organizations (3:00)
When talking to standards organizations, emphasize:

1. **Increased Effective Adoption**
   - MVMD helps creators use their standard correctly
   - Ensures assets work interoperably
   - Makes their standard more valuable in practice

2. **Platform Relevance**
   - Platforms need standardized metadata
   - MVMD ensures their standard is part of the solution
   - Helps platforms adopt their standard

3. **Completing the Picture**
   - Shows how their standard fits in the complete metadata description
   - Helps creators understand when to use their standard
   - Makes their standard more accessible
