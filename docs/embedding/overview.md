# Overview

The Embedding section covers technical standards and implementations for incorporating content directly within metadata. For a detailed understanding of when to embed versus reference content through URIs, please review the [URIs vs Embedding](/concepts/uris-vs-embedding.md) section in Core Concepts.

## Available Standards

### Schema.org and JSON-LD
Foundational standards for structured metadata:
- Schema.org vocabulary implementation
- JSON-LD context handling
- Property embedding patterns
- Type declarations

Jump to the [Schema.org](./embedding/schema/schema-org.md) section.

### 3D Asset Standards
Standards for embedding 3D content:
- glTF: Efficient 3D content delivery
- USD: Complex scene description
- VRM: Humanoid avatars
- X3D: Web-based 3D graphics
- FBX: Animation and rigging
- COLLADA: Asset exchange
- OpenXR: VR/AR content

Jump to the [3D Assets](./embedding/3d-assets/) section.

### Geospatial Standards
Standards for location-based content:
- CityJSON: Urban environments
- 3D Tiles: Large-scale datasets

Jump to the [Geospatial](./embedding/geospatial/) section.

### Trust and Provenance
Standards for content verification:
- C2PA: Content authenticity
- Digital signatures
- Chain of custody

Jump to the [Trust and Provenance](./embedding/trust/) section.

## Getting Started

Start by understanding the [Schema.org](./embedding/schema/schema-org.md) base structure, then explore specific embedding standards based on your asset types. Review the [URIs vs Embedding](/concepts/uris-vs-embedding.md) section to make informed decisions about when to embed content versus using external references.

The embedding standards documented here will continue to evolve as new formats and techniques emerge. Check the MVMD GitHub repository regularly for updates and new standard additions.
