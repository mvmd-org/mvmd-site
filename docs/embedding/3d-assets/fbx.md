# FBX Standard

FBX (Filmbox) is a proprietary 3D file format developed by Kaydara and acquired by Autodesk in 2006. It serves as an interchange format for 3D assets, enabling seamless data exchange between various digital content creation applications. FBX files can store a wide range of data, including 3D models, animations, textures, lighting, and more, facilitating interoperability in workflows involving multiple software tools.

## File Format Details

FBX files can be saved in either binary or ASCII formats, both using the .fbx extension. The binary format is more compact and efficient for storage and transfer, while the ASCII format is human-readable, allowing for easier debugging and editing. Despite its widespread use, the FBX file format is proprietary, and its full specifications are not publicly available. However, Autodesk provides an FBX Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows developers to integrate FBX support into their applications.

## Data Referencing and Embedding

While FBX files can embed certain data types, such as textures, directly within the file, this practice can significantly increase file size and may not be supported by all software applications. Therefore, it's common practice to reference external data files, such as textures and other media, rather than embedding them within the FBX file. This approach maintains manageable file sizes and ensures compatibility across different platforms and tools. When referencing external files, it's crucial to maintain the correct file paths and include all necessary external resources when sharing or transferring the FBX file to ensure all referenced data is accessible.

## Key Features of FBX

- Interoperability: Facilitates the exchange of 3D assets between different software applications, enhancing workflow efficiency.

- Comprehensive Data Storage: Supports a wide array of data types, including geometry, textures, animations, cameras, and lighting.

- Binary and ASCII Formats: Offers both binary and ASCII file formats, catering to different needs for efficiency and readability.

## Limitations

While FBX is widely adopted, it is a proprietary format, which can pose challenges for developers seeking to implement support without using Autodesk's SDK. Additionally, the lack of publicly available specifications can hinder efforts to fully understand and manipulate the file format independently.
