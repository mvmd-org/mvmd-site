# Overview

The Recipes section provides standardized metadata templates for common Metaverse asset types. These recipes combine multiple standards and best practices into ready-to-use patterns that ensure interoperability and functionality across different platforms and environments.

## Available Recipes

### Composable 3D NFT Recipe
Currently our only published recipe, defining metadata for complex 3D NFTs that can be broken down into component parts:
- NFT standard compatibility
- Component relationships
- 3D model integration
- Asset composition
- Preview generation
- Technical specifications

Jump to the [Composable 3D NFT Recipe](./composable-3d-nft.md).
