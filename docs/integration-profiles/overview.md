# Integration Profiles Overview

The Integration Profiles section provides standardized metadata templates for common Metaverse asset types. These profiles combine multiple standards and best practices into ready-to-use patterns that ensure interoperability and functionality across different platforms and environments.

## Available Integration Profiles

### Composable 3D NFT Integration Profile
Currently our only published profile, defining metadata for complex 3D NFTs that can be broken down into component parts:
- Modular asset structure
- Component relationships
- Composition rules
- Validation requirements
- Implementation examples
- Best practices

Jump to the [Composable 3D NFT Integration Profile](./composable-3d-nft.md).

## Planned Integration Profiles

We have several integration profiles in development that will be released after community review:

### Digital Twin
- Physical-digital synchronization
- Sensor data integration
- State management
- Update mechanisms
- Access control

### Vehicle
- Physics properties
- Control systems
- Interaction points
- Animation states
- Sound configuration

### Identity
- Cross-platform identifiers
- Reputation systems
- Achievement tracking
- Social connections
- Privacy controls

### Royalty
- Revenue distribution
- Usage tracking
- Payment systems
- Rights management
- Validation rules

Additional integration profiles under consideration:
- Wearable items
- Equipment systems
- Interactive objects
- Virtual environments

5. Submit a pull request

## Next Steps

Start with our published [Composable 3D NFT Integration Profile](./composable-3d-nft.md) to understand how integration profiles combine multiple standards into practical implementation patterns. Monitor our GitHub repository for new profile releases and opportunities to contribute to upcoming templates.

For contributing organizations: review the [Future Integration Profiles](./future.md) section to identify gaps and opportunities for new profiles that could benefit the broader Metaverse ecosystem.

Remember that integration profiles are living documents that will evolve as standards mature and new use cases emerge. Your contributions help build a more interoperable and robust Metaverse for everyone.
