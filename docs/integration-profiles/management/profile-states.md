# Integration Profile States

Integration profiles in MVMD go through different states as they mature and are adopted by the community.

## Profile States

### Proposed

A profile in the "Proposed" state:
- Is under active community review
- May change significantly based on feedback
- Has not been fully implemented or tested in production
- Needs more real-world validation

### Approved

A profile in the "Approved" state:
- Has been thoroughly reviewed by the community
- Has at least one production implementation
- Has proven its value in real-world use cases
- Is stable and unlikely to change significantly

## State Transition Process

### From Proposed to Approved

To move a profile from Proposed to Approved state:

1. **Implementation Requirements**
   - At least one complete implementation in production
   - Documentation of implementation experience
   - Validation of the profile's effectiveness

2. **Community Review**
   - Open review period (minimum 30 days)
   - Collection and addressing of community feedback
   - Resolution of any identified issues

3. **Technical Committee Review**
   - Review by MVMD technical committee
   - Verification of implementation evidence
   - Assessment of community feedback

4. **Approval Process**
   - Formal proposal for state change
   - Technical committee vote
   - Public announcement of approval

### Profile Updates

- **Proposed Profiles**: Can be updated freely with community input
- **Approved Profiles**: Changes follow semantic versioning
  - Major changes require a new proposal
  - Minor changes need technical committee review
  - Patches can be applied directly
