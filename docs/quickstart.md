# Quickstart

Welcome to the Metaverse Metadata Directory (MVMD). This guide will help you navigate our documentation and find the information most relevant to your needs.

## Structure
The following is the high-level categories of this documentation.

### [Concepts](./concepts/overview.md)
Start here to understand the fundamental principles of metadata in the Metaverse:
- Core metadata concepts and Schema.org foundations
- Understanding different types of assets and their relationships
- Learning when to use URLs vs embedding content
- Essential data structures and organization patterns

### [Implementation](./implementation/overview.md)
Learn how to implement metadata for your assets:
- Basic asset metadata implementation
- NFT metadata integration
- Working with composable assets
- Best practices for implementation

### [Recipes](./recipes/overview.md)
Ready-to-use patterns for common Metaverse asset types:
- Wearables and equipment
- Avatars and characters
- 3D objects and scenes
- Interactive elements
- Virtual and physical locations

### [Embedding](./embedding/overview.md)
Detailed technical standards for embedding different types of data:
- Schema.org and JSON-LD usage
- 3D asset formats (glTF, USD, etc.)
- Geospatial data integration
- Authentication and provenance tracking

### Tools
- Schema [validation](./tools/validator.md)
- [Mintr](./tools/mintr.md) for creating metaverse NFTs

## Common Use Cases

### "I'm new to Metaverse metadata"
1. Start with [Concepts](./concepts/overview.md) to understand the basics
2. Review [Implementation](./implementation/overview.md) for practical guidance
3. Follow our [Basic Recipe](./recipes/basic.md) for your first implementation

### "I need to implement a specific asset type"
1. Check our [Recipes](./recipes/overview.md) for your asset type
2. Review relevant [Embedding](./embedding/overview.md) standards
3. [Validate](./tools/validator.md) your implementation

### "I want to integrate MVMD assets on my platform"
1. Study our [Implementation](./implementation/overview.md) guide
2. Review all relevant [Embedding](./embedding/overview.md) standards
3. Implement proper [Best Practices](./implementation/best-practices.md)

## Next Steps
