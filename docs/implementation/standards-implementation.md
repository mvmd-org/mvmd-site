# Standards Implementation

:::info Content Reorganization
As part of our documentation restructuring, the content from this page has been reorganized:

- **Standard-specific implementation details** have been moved to dedicated namespace pages:
  - [glTF Namespace](/docs/namespaces/gltf) - For all glTF-specific implementation details and schema
  - [USD Namespace](/docs/namespaces/usd) - For all USD-specific implementation details and schema
  
- **Implementation patterns** have been reorganized into use case-focused guides:
  - [Cross-Platform Asset Implementation](./cross-platform-assets.md) - For implementing assets across multiple platforms
  - [Interactive Asset Implementation](./interactive-assets.md) - For implementing interactive behaviors
  - [Discovery and Search Optimization](./discovery-optimization.md) - For optimizing assets for discovery

This reorganization provides more targeted guidance based on specific implementation needs rather than focusing on technical standards.
:::

## Implementation Approaches by Standard

For standard-specific implementation details, please refer to the appropriate namespace documentation:

- [glTF Namespace](/docs/namespaces/gltf) - For glTF 3D models
- [USD Namespace](/docs/namespaces/usd) - For Universal Scene Description assets
- [OpenXR Namespace](/docs/namespaces/openxr) - For XR experiences

## Implementation Approaches by Use Case

For use case-based implementation patterns, refer to these implementation guides:

- [Basic Asset Implementation](./assets.md) - Core implementation patterns for all assets
- [Cross-Platform Asset Implementation](./cross-platform-assets.md) - For multi-platform compatibility
- [Interactive Asset Implementation](./interactive-assets.md) - For interactive behavior
- [Discovery and Search Optimization](./discovery-optimization.md) - For discovery and search
- [NFT Implementation](./nfts.md) - For blockchain-connected assets
- [Composable Asset Implementation](./composable.md) - For multi-component assets
