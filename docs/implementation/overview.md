# Implementation Overview

This section provides practical guidance for implementing MVMD in real-world applications. You'll find patterns, best practices, and examples for different implementation scenarios.

## Implementation Approaches

### Basic Asset Metadata

Every implementation starts with properly structured metadata for your digital assets:

- Define clear type declarations with Schema.org vocabulary
- Include required properties for discoverability
- Add specialized properties for specific use cases
- Set up proper relationships between components

[Learn about Basic Asset Implementation](./assets.md)

### NFT Metadata

For blockchain-connected assets, MVMD provides standards-compliant approaches:

- Maintain compatibility with ERC-721/ERC-1155 standards
- Enhance NFT metadata with rich structured data
- Support multi-platform NFT discoverability
- Enable verifiable authenticity and provenance

[Explore NFT Implementation](./nfts.md)

### Composable Systems

For complex, multi-component assets:

- Implement structural relationships between components
- Define assembly patterns and constraints
- Create flexible, extensible component systems
- Support cross-platform composition

## Implementation Best Practices

Regardless of your specific use case, follow these principles:

- **Consistency**: Use standardized naming and structure patterns
- **Precision**: Include only necessary data at the appropriate level
- **Scalability**: Design for future expansion and additions
- **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility across platforms
- **Validation**: Regularly validate against schema requirements

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) guide
2. Choose the appropriate pattern for your asset type
3. Use our [templates](../templates/) for consistent implementation
4. Validate your implementation with our [tools](../reference/validator.md)
