# Overview
This section introduces the fundamental concepts needed to understand and implement metadata for Metaverse assets. Each subsection builds upon the previous ones to provide a comprehensive understanding of how metadata works in the Metaverse context.

## Core Topics

### Fundamentals
Learn the essential building blocks of Metaverse metadata, including:
- Schema.org foundations
- JSON-LD structure
- Required contexts
- Basic metadata patterns

Jump to the [Fundamentals page](/concepts/fundamentals.md).

### Types of Things
Understand the different Schema.org types used in MVMD:
- Core types for digital assets
- Media object types
- Virtual and physical locations
- Applications and documents

Jump to the [Types of Things page](/concepts/types-of-things.md).

### Composition
Explore how different assets can be combined and related:
- Component relationships
- Asset hierarchies
- Content embedding
- Resource management

Jump to the [Composition page](/concepts/composition.md).

### References
Learn how to create and manage references between assets:
- Direct references
- Structured references
- Alternative versions
- Media relationships

Jump to the [References page](/concepts/references.md).

### URLs vs Embedding
Understand when to reference external content versus embedding it directly:
- URL-based references
- Embedded content
- Mixed approaches
- Best practices

Jump to the [URIs vs Embedding page](/concepts/uris-vs-embedding.md).

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Fundamentals](./fundamentals.md) section to establish a solid foundation, then progress through the other topics in order. Each concept builds upon previous ones to create a complete understanding of Metaverse metadata implementation.
