# Terms Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the MVMD documentation. Understanding these terms is essential for working effectively with metaverse metadata.

## A

### Asset
A digital item or resource, such as a 3D model, image, sound, or scene, used in metaverse experiences.

### Avatar
A digital representation of a user or character in a virtual environment, often customizable and animated.

## C

### Composition
The process of combining multiple metadata components or assets into a cohesive whole, establishing relationships between parts.

### Context
In JSON-LD, the `@context` field defines the vocabulary and rules for interpreting metadata, establishing namespaces for properties.

### CreativeWork
A Schema.org type representing a creative product, such as artwork, literature, music, or in our case, digital assets.

## D

### Digital Twin
A virtual representation of a physical object, environment, or system that mirrors its real-world counterpart.

## E

### Embedding
The practice of including data directly within a metadata document rather than referencing it externally.

### Encodingformat
A property specifying the file format of a resource, such as "model/gltf-binary" for GLB files.

## I

### Integration Profile
A pre-defined template for implementing metadata for specific asset types or use cases, providing a standardized approach.

### Interoperability
The ability for different systems, platforms, or standards to work together seamlessly.

## J

### JSON-LD
JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data, a method of encoding linked data using JSON, which serves as the format for MVMD metadata.

## L

### Linked Data
A method of publishing structured data so that it can be interlinked and more useful, forming a web of data.

## M

### Metadata
Data that provides information about other data; in MVMD, it describes digital assets and their properties.

### Metaverse
A collective virtual shared space, created by the convergence of virtually enhanced physical reality and physically persistent virtual reality.

### MVMD
Metaverse Metadata Directory, a framework for integrating various metadata standards for metaverse assets.

## N

### Namespace
A container for a set of identifiers, used in JSON-LD to differentiate between properties from different standards.

### NFT
Non-Fungible Token, a unique digital asset whose ownership is tracked on a blockchain.

## P

### Property
A characteristic or attribute of an asset defined in metadata, such as "name," "description," or "contentUrl."

## R

### Reference
A pointer to another resource, typically using a URL or URI, rather than embedding the resource directly.

### Resource
Any digital asset, document, or entity that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled in the metaverse.

## S

### Schema.org
A collaborative, community activity with a mission to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet.

### Standard
A documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria designed to be used consistently as rules, guidelines, or definitions.

## T

### Type
In Schema.org and JSON-LD, the `@type` property defines what kind of object is being described, such as "3DModel" or "CreativeWork."

## U

### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)
A string of characters designed for unambiguous identification of resources, commonly used in metadata to reference other resources.

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)
A specific type of URI that identifies a resource and also provides a means of locating it, typically by specifying the network location.

## V

### Validation
The process of checking whether metadata conforms to the expected structure, format, and relationships defined by standards.

### Virtual World
A computer-simulated environment that may represent aspects of the real world or imaginary worlds, populated by users who can interact with the environment and each other.

## W

### Wearable
A digital asset designed to be worn by an avatar in a virtual environment, such as clothing, accessories, or equipment.
