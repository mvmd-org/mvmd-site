The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement.

It represents an information update made by a\\n      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\\n      local government.\\n\\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\\n\\nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\\nexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our\\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\\n\\n\\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\\nthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.\\n\\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\\n\\nWe encourage the provision of \\"name\\", \\"text\\", \\"datePosted\\", \\"expires\\" (if appropriate), \\"category\\" and\\n\\"url\\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \\"category\\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\\\_coronavirus\\\\_pandemic\\" or \\"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\\".\\n\\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property\'s value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \\"[[text]]\\" summary of the page. It is\\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.\\n\\nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\\n\\nMany [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\\n\\nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\\nfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.\\n\\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting\\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\\nwith the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing\\nmedia type information, e.g. \\"application/rss+xml\\" or \\"application/atom+xml\\".\\n","properties":["webFeed","datePosted","schoolClosuresInfo","diseaseSpreadStatistics","diseasePreventionInfo","category","newsUpdatesAndGuidelines","gettingTestedInfo","announcementLocation","publicTransportClosuresInfo","quarantineGuidelines","governmentBenefitsInfo","travelBans"]},"WorkersUnion":{"id":"WorkersUnion","label":"WorkersUnion","comment":"A Workers Union (also known as a Labor Union, Labour Union, or Trade Union) is an organization that promotes the interests of its worker members by collectively bargaining with management, organizing, and political lobbying.","properties":[]},"ArriveAction":{"id":"ArriveAction","label":"ArriveAction","comment":"The act of arriving at a place.

As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible.
