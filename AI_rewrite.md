## Succinct Documentation Review

**Developer Journey Issues:**
- Implementation guides contain redundant explanations across multiple sections
- Code examples in gltf.md and cross-platform-assets.md are unnecessarily verbose
- Navigation between related implementation steps is unclear

**Standards Registry Issues:**
- Technical terminology inconsistency (namespace vs. standard) throughout standards documentation
- Schema references lack clear purpose statements
- Integration patterns described with excessive text rather than clear examples

**Platform Developer Issues:**
- Profile requirements described with narrative text instead of precise specifications
- Validation requirements spread across multiple sections causing redundancy
- Implementation steps contain unnecessary context explanation

**Content Creator Issues:**
- Technical details mixed with creator guidance creating confusion
- Examples contain excessive implementation details irrelevant to creators
- Validation steps described with unnecessary technical background

## Direct Improvements:

1. **Remove redundant explanations** in implementation guides - particularly in cross-platform-assets.md which repeats concepts already covered elsewhere

2. **Simplify code examples** - reduce example verbosity by 30-50% while maintaining complete functionality

3. **Standardize terminology** - consistently use either "standard" or "namespace" throughout all documentation

4. **Convert narrative text to specifications** - replace paragraphs of explanation with concise requirement lists in profile documentation

5. **Separate technical from usage guidance** - clearly delineate creator-focused vs developer-focused content within each document

These changes focus on making existing content more succinct and usable for all user types without adding new material.

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Content Reduction & Standardization

#### Step 1: Remove Redundant Explanations
**Prompt**: "Review the implementation guides, especially cross-platform-assets.md, interactive-assets.md, and discovery-optimization.md. Remove all redundant explanations that repeat concepts already explained in other sections or documents. Maintain all unique information. Focus on removing paragraph-level duplications while preserving essential information. 

After reviewing each document, create a summary of:
1. What specific redundancies were removed
2. Any concepts that appear in multiple documents that might benefit from centralization
3. Any inconsistencies found between repeated explanations

Add this summary to a new section called 'Documentation Issues Log' at the end of this document for reference in later steps."

**Files requiring review**:
- docs/implementation/cross-platform-assets.md (priority - contains verbose examples and redundant concepts)
- docs/implementation/interactive-assets.md (lengthy with repeated concepts)
- docs/implementation/discovery-optimization.md (contains redundant explanations)
- docs/implementation/nfts.md (check for overlapping content with other guides)
- docs/implementation/composable.md (check for overlap with cross-platform content)

#### Step 2: Simplify Code Examples
**Prompt**: "Simplify code examples in standards/gltf.md, implementation/cross-platform-assets.md, and all integration profile documents. Reduce example verbosity by 30-50% while maintaining complete functionality. Remove unnecessary properties and comments while ensuring each example clearly demonstrates its intended concept.

For each simplified example, document:
1. What properties were removed and why they were deemed unnecessary
2. Whether the example still demonstrates all key concepts
3. Any patterns found across examples that could be standardized

Add these findings to the 'Documentation Issues Log' for use in later validation steps."

**Files requiring review**:
- docs/standards/gltf.md (verbose examples with too many properties)
- docs/implementation/cross-platform-assets.md (contains unnecessarily complex JSON examples)
- docs/integration-profiles/avatar.md (complex examples with redundant properties)
- docs/integration-profiles/attachable.md (examples can be simplified)
- docs/integration-profiles/composable-3d-nft.md (contains verbose examples)
- docs/integration-profiles/vehicle.md (examples with excessive detail)

#### Step 3: Standardize Terminology
**Prompt**: "Standardize terminology across all standards documents and reference/schemas.md by consistently using 'standard' instead of 'namespace' when referring to technical standards. Ensure all technical terms align with the terminology specified in the style guide.

After standardizing terminology, create a list of:
1. All instances where terminology was changed
2. Any additional inconsistent terms found beyond 'namespace/standard'
3. Recommended updates to the terminology section of the style guide based on findings

Add this list to the 'Documentation Issues Log' to inform the final consistency check phase."

**Files requiring review**:
- docs/standards/overview.md (uses 'namespace' extensively)
- docs/standards/gltf.md (inconsistent terminology)
- docs/standards/usd.md (uses 'namespace' when referring to standards)
- docs/standards/vrm.md (inconsistent terminology)
- docs/standards/collada.md (uses 'namespace' throughout)
- docs/standards/3d-tiles.md (inconsistent term usage)
- docs/reference/schemas.md (may use inconsistent terminology)
- docs/reference/glossary.md (ensure terminology definitions are consistent)

### Phase 2: Content Restructuring

#### Step 4: Convert Narrative to Specifications
**Prompt**: "Transform narrative text descriptions in all integration profile documents and validation/schema-validation.md into concise, structured specification lists. Convert explanatory paragraphs into bullet points or tables with clear 'Required' and 'Optional' designations. Reformat existing information without adding new content.

After restructuring each document, document:
1. Sections where narrative was converted to structured content
2. Any requirements that were clarified during conversion
3. Any inconsistencies found between requirements in different documents

Update the 'Documentation Issues Log' with these findings to inform cross-reference improvements in Phase 3."

**Files requiring review**:
- docs/integration-profiles/avatar.md (contains narrative descriptions of requirements)
- docs/integration-profiles/attachable.md (narrative explanations of specs)
- docs/integration-profiles/basic.md (needs more structured requirements)
- docs/integration-profiles/digital-twin.md (lengthy narrative explanations)
- docs/integration-profiles/scene.md (narrative style explanations)
- docs/validation/schema-validation.md (contains paragraph explanations that should be lists)

#### Step 5: Separate Technical and Usage Guidance
**Prompt**: "Restructure implementation/overview.md, standards/gltf.md, standards/usd.md, and validation/overview.md to clearly separate technical implementation details from usage guidance. Create distinct sections with appropriate headers for different audience types while maintaining all existing content.

After separating content for each document, create a summary of:
1. The specific sections created for different audience types
2. Any content that was difficult to categorize
3. Common patterns in how technical vs. usage content is structured

Add these findings to the 'Documentation Issues Log' to inform template improvements for future documentation."

**Files requiring review**:
- docs/implementation/overview.md (mixes technical and usage content)
- docs/standards/gltf.md (needs clearer separation between developer and creator guidance)
- docs/standards/usd.md (similar mixing of technical and usage details)
- docs/validation/overview.md (combines technical details with basic guidance)
- docs/standards/schema-org.md (contains mixed audience content)

### Phase 3: Navigation & Consistency Improvements

#### Step 6: Enhance Cross-References
**Prompt**: "Add precise cross-references to all implementation guides and profile documents. Insert links to directly related documents using relative paths. Only reference existing documents that contain information supporting the current topic.

Use the 'Documentation Issues Log' from previous steps to identify key relationships between documents. After enhancing cross-references, document:
1. All added cross-references by document
2. Any missing documents that should exist but don't
3. Circular reference chains or dependency issues discovered

Update the 'Documentation Issues Log' with these findings to inform the final quality assurance phase."

**Files requiring review**:
- All implementation guides (docs/implementation/*.md)
- All profile documents (docs/integration-profiles/*.md)
- Key concept documents (docs/concepts/*.md)
- Priority focus on:
  - docs/implementation/cross-platform-assets.md
  - docs/implementation/interactive-assets.md
  - docs/integration-profiles/avatar.md
  - docs/integration-profiles/composable-3d-nft.md

#### Step 7: Standardize Document Structure
**Prompt**: "Identify all documents that don't match their appropriate templates (run validate-docs.js to find them). Restructure each non-compliant document to match its document type template exactly, moving existing content into correct sections without adding new material.

Refer to the 'Documentation Issues Log' for any structural issues identified in earlier phases. After standardizing document structures, document:
1. All documents modified and what template was applied
2. Any sections that had to be added or removed
3. Any content that didn't fit cleanly into the template structure

Add these findings to the 'Documentation Issues Log' to inform the final consistency check."

**Files potentially requiring review (based on inconsistencies):**
- docs/standards/openxr.md (section structure different from other standards)
- docs/integration-profiles/interactable.md (incomplete document structure)
- docs/integration-profiles/future.md (non-standard format)
- Any files flagged by validation tools

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance

#### Step 8: Run Validation & Fix Issues
**Prompt**: "Run the validation script (scripts/validate-docs.js) and fix all identified issues across the documentation. Address each error category (front matter, heading structure, terminology, links, code blocks) with minimal changes to correct specific validation errors.

Reference the 'Documentation Issues Log' for known issues from previous phases. After validation, document:
1. A summary of all validation errors by category
2. Which errors were fixed and which require further attention
3. Any patterns in validation errors that suggest systematic issues

Update the 'Documentation Issues Log' with these findings for the final consistency check."

**Files to validate**: All documentation files, with special attention to:
- Newly modified files from previous steps
- Files with complex structures or examples
- Files that may have missed earlier template updates

#### Step 9: Final Consistency Check
**Prompt**: "Perform a final review of all modified documents for consistency with the style guide. Focus specifically on terminology, heading structure, and code formatting, making only necessary corrections to ensure compliance.

Use the complete 'Documentation Issues Log' from all previous phases as a checklist. After the final review, create a summary report that includes:
1. All issues addressed throughout the improvement process
2. Any remaining minor inconsistencies that were deemed acceptable
3. Recommendations for further documentation improvements

This will serve as the final documentation of the improvement process."

**Files to check:**
- All modified documents from previous phases
- Key landing pages and overview documents
- Documentation that crosses multiple user journeys
