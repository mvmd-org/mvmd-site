# Overview

This section provides practical guidance for implementing metadata in Metaverse applications and platforms. Each subsection covers different aspects of implementation, from basic asset descriptions to complex composable systems.

## Core Topics

### Getting Started
Learn the essential implementation steps, including:
- Basic metadata structure
- Required properties
- Implementation patterns
- Initial validation steps

Jump to the [Getting Started page](/implementation/getting-started.md).

### Assets
Understand how to implement metadata for different asset types:
- Storage strategies
- Cross-platform integration
- Asset packaging
- Implementation features
- Portal implementation
- Multi-platform considerations

Jump to the [Assets page](/implementation/assets.md).

### NFTs
Learn how to implement metadata for NFT assets:
- ERC-721 compatibility
- Schema.org integration
- Platform compatibility
- Enhanced NFT capabilities
- Multiple asset formats
- Authentication and rights

Jump to the [NFTs page](/implementation/nfts.md).

### Composable Assets
Explore implementation patterns for composable assets:
- Basic composition patterns
- Advanced assembly systems
- Component relationships
- Constraint systems
- Validation requirements
- Performance considerations

Jump to the [Composable page](/implementation/composable.md).

### Best Practices
Study recommended implementation approaches:
- Metadata structure
- Content quality
- Asset relationships
- Version management
- Rights management
- Technical specifications

Jump to the [Best Practices page](/implementation/best-practices.md).

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Getting Started](./getting-started.md) section to establish implementation fundamentals, then progress through other topics based on your needs. Each implementation topic builds on the core concepts while providing practical examples and guidance for real-world usage.

After reviewing the implementation basics, you can dive deeper into specific asset types or explore advanced topics like composability and NFT integration. The Best Practices section provides valuable guidelines for ensuring your implementation is robust and maintainable.
