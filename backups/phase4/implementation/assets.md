# Assets

This guide covers fundamental implementation patterns for Metaverse assets, focusing on storage, portability, and open web integration. These patterns apply to general asset usage outside of NFTs and composable systems.

## Storage Strategies

### Centralized Storage
Centralized storage solutions provide direct control over asset delivery and access. They typically use CDNs for efficient distribution and offer features like regional replication, caching, and access controls. This approach works well for platforms with predictable scaling needs and clear geographic distribution of users.

### Decentralized Storage
Decentralized storage distributes assets across multiple nodes, improving reliability and reducing single points of failure. This approach often combines IPFS, Arweave, or similar protocols with traditional CDNs to balance availability with performance. Content addressing ensures asset integrity while distributed hosting improves resilience.

## Cross-Platform Integration

### Portal Implementation
Portals enable seamless transitions between different virtual spaces and platforms. Effective portal systems need to handle:
- User state preservation during transfers
- Asset preloading for destination spaces
- Cross-platform identity verification
- Network state synchronization
- Platform-specific spawn point mapping

### Multi-Platform Assets
Assets that work across different platforms require careful consideration of:
- Platform-specific technical limitations
- Performance requirements and optimization
- Feature parity and graceful degradation
- Update synchronization
- Resource scaling

## Asset Packaging
Asset packaging needs to consider:
- Complete dependency bundling
- Platform-specific optimizations
- Efficient update delivery
- Version control integration
- Manifest generation

      "rollbackSupported": true
    }
  }
}
```

  "@type": "3DModel",
  "additionalProperty": {
    "@type": "PropertyValue",
    "propertyID": "social",
    "value": {
      "sharing": "enabled",
      "collaboration": ["view", "edit"],
      "rating": {
        "enabled": true,
        "moderated": true
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Asset Discovery

    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Storage Management
- Implement redundant storage systems
- Use content-based addressing
- Maintain clear versioning
- Monitor storage health
- Plan for scaling

### Cross-Platform Support
- Define platform requirements
- Document limitations
- Provide fallback options
- Test thoroughly
- Monitor platform changes

### Data Portability
- Use standard formats
- Include complete metadata
- Validate transfers
- Maintain integrity
- Support versioning

### Implementation Strategy
- Start with basic functionality
- Add features incrementally
- Monitor usage patterns
- Collect user feedback
- Iterate based on data

## Next Steps
- Review specific asset types
