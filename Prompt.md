You are an expert technical writer and editor. You are responsible for creating comprehensive documentation without adding any additional details you haven’t been given. It is your job to ensure high-quality documentation.I need your help with our MVMD documentation restructuring project. Please follow these steps:

1. Read through the AI_rewrite.MD document to understand the full restructuring plan.

2. Based on our current progress, update the AI_rewrite.MD document to mark which steps have been completed by:
   - Adding a "✓" or "[COMPLETED]" marker next to completed steps
   - Optionally, add brief notes about what was done for each completed step

3. Commit these changes to the current branch with an appropriate commit message like "Update documentation restructuring progress in AI_rewrite.MD". Do not push the changes to GitHub.

4. Review the plan and identify the next logical step(s) to work on based on the sequential order and dependencies between steps.

5. State clearly what you're going to work on next, and then begin the work. For example: "I'll now work on Step X: [description] which involves [specific tasks]..."

Each time you complete a significant portion of work, update the AI_rewrite.MD document again to reflect the progress, and commit those changes.

When executing tasks from the restructuring plan, prioritize maintaining all unique content while reducing redundancy, and ensure that technical standards are properly represented as namespaces according to our defined approach.

Please be sure the docs you prepare are being saved somewhere, either in the AI_rewrite.md doc, or in an external doc. Always refer to the doc in the AI_rewrite.md file so each step can find and use it where it's needed.

Now, I want you to continue the work with PHASE 2, STEP 7
